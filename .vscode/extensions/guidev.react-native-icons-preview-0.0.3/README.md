To make it even easier to insert React Native icons, the extension includes snippets. Use the following shortcuts followed by the icon name:

   - `fi`: Feather
   - `fa`: FontAwesome
   - `fa5`: FontAwesome5

   For example, typing `ai-user` will suggest `<AntDesign name="user" color="black" size={25}/>`.
